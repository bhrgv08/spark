<p><strong>Loneliness in Older Adults and Its Impact on Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>Even in a world where social media and technology are fostering relationships, loneliness still exists and affects one of the most vulnerable populations – the elderly – the most. The hidden battle of loneliness among the elderly often goes unrecognised as we navigate the fast-paced rhythms of modern life, but its impact on mental health is significant and widespread.</p>
<p><em>The Phenomenon of Loneliness in Older Adults</em></p>
<p>Although ageing is a necessary aspect of life, it frequently brings about major changes that might lead to isolation from society. The severe emotion of loneliness that many seniors endure can be aggravated by retirement, physical restrictions, the loss of a spouse or friends, and geographic separation from loved ones.</p>
<p>Although isolation and feeling alone may seem similar, they are not. Physical separation can be described as isolation, while the emotional sense of lacking meaningful relationships or company is known as loneliness. Even though they may be surrounded by people, a lot of seniors find themselves in settings where they feel extremely alone and desire for real connections and meaningful interactions.</p>
<p><em>Impact on Mental Health</em></p>
<p>It is alarming how loneliness affects mental health. Various studies have shown that loneliness in elderly people is associated with a higher risk of anxiety, sadness, mental decline, and even physical health problems including immune system weakness and cardiovascular disease. Lack of social engagement can exacerbate emotions of helplessness and deepen the cycle of loneliness by impairing cognitive function.</p>
<p>In addition, loneliness might also have medical implications in addition to being a psychological burden. Prolonged isolation causes the body to go into stress mode, which raises stress hormone levels and can eventually be harmful to general health and wellbeing.</p>
<p><em>Addressing Elderly Loneliness</em></p>
<p>Finding successful solutions for tackling senior loneliness requires an understanding of its varied character. Loneliness can be substantially decreased by programmes that promote digital literacy, intergenerational activities, and community involvement among elders.</p>
<p>Promoting community engagement via volunteer work, clubs, or senior centres, helps people feel like they belong and have a purpose. Intergenerational programmes are beneficial to both the elderly and the younger participants because they foster meaningful connections and challenge age-related preconceptions.</p>
<p>Also, it is priceless to use technology to close the generational divide. Seniors who are taught how to use online forums, video calls, and social media can feel less alone because they are able to maintain connections with their loved ones and the wider community.</p>
<p>It is crucial to assist the elderly in continuing to lead active social lives. By routinely checking in, investing quality time, and participating in socially engaging activities, family members, neighbours, and caregivers may make a big difference.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Elder loneliness is a heartbreaking reality that has to be addressed. To deal with this silent epidemic, empathy, compassion, and proactive measures are essential. We are all capable of working together to create a society where our senior population feels appreciated, connected, and cherished by promoting inclusive communities, valuing intergenerational relationships, and embracing technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Let us not let melancholy cast a shadow on the knowledge and experiences of our elders. Let&#8217;s work together to create a society where all senior citizens are respected, heard, and enveloped in a loving network of companionship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>Understanding, Preventing, and Responding to Elder Abuse</u></strong></p>
<p>Elder abuse presents a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands a systematic approach encompassing nuanced identification, proactive prevention, and decisive action. Understanding the intricate nature of this issue and employing sophisticated strategies are pivotal in safeguarding the well-being and dignity of our senior population.</p>
<p><em>Detecting Elder Abuse: Insidious Signs and Complex Expressions</em></p>
<p>Comprehending the subtleties of elder abuse is essential to addressing this widespread problem. There are various kinds of elder abuse beyond physical injury, such as verbal, financial, psychological and sexual. The intricate relationships between these dimensions require a thorough comprehension and increased awareness in order to uncover underlying abuse in these complex situations.</p>
<p>According to Dream Sparks Foundation’s nationwide research report ‘Bridge the Gap: Understanding Elder Needs (2022), 59% of elderly report abuse as being prevalent in Indian society, while 46% of the elders were not aware of any abuse redressal mechanism.</p>
<p><em>Preventive Techniques: An All-Inclusive Method Including People and Organisations</em></p>
<p>The prevention of elder abuse requires broad strategies that target systemic flaws and provide individuals and organisations with the resources they need to stand up to mistreatment. Campaigns for education and awareness lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of abuse patterns and provide individuals with the skills necessary to recognise and report abuse.</p>
<p>In addition, building strong support systems in families and communities creates barriers of protection, allowing for early intervention and support for older people who are at risk. One important way to prevent abuse incidents is to reinforce the legal frameworks that regulate care facilities and social service organisations and provide thorough training to staff members on identifying and reporting abuse.</p>
<p>Advocacy and awareness campaigns are key initiatives. Through partnerships with local communities, educational institutions, and establishments, it is essential to raise awareness about warning signs of abuse, the value of showing respect to seniors, and where to turn for assistance. In order to stop abuse and exploitation, it is important to educate the elderly about their rights.</p>
<p>Collaborations between stakeholders such as civil society organisations, government agencies and policymakers are needed to influence policy changes aimed at protecting the rights of the elderly. Research-backed advocacy will create a more conducive legal and social environment that safeguards the elderly from abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Society must come together to counter the alarming rise in elder abuse and commit to create a society where the elderly are respected, protected, and empowered to live a life of dignity and security. We can create a society where seniors are protected, valued, and adored as pillars of knowledge and experience by implementing comprehensive initiatives, building community awareness, and creating a culture of vigilance and support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Addressing the Intersection of Age and Disability: Policy Challenges in India</u></strong></p>
<p>Ageing is an inevitable part of life, and it often brings with it an increased likelihood of experiencing disability, both physical and cognitive. According to UNDESA, more than 46 percent of individuals aged 60 and above have disabilities, with over 250 million older people experiencing moderate to severe disability worldwide. Persons with disabilities face numerous challenges, including accessibility barriers, discrimination, limited job opportunities, and as age advances, these hurdles become more complex.</p>
<p>A longer lifespan is associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and impairments. Thanks to advancements in technology and healthcare, many persons with disabilities now live longer, and the majority of this population comprises older persons.</p>
<p>In India, the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India (LASI) Wave 1 reported that 10.5 percent of individuals aged 60 and above have at least one physical or mental impairment. These impairments range from locomotor, mental, visual, hearing, to speech impairments. Additionally, 23.8 percent of older persons in India have at least one Activity of Daily Limitation (ADL), 43.8 percent have at least one Instrumental Activity of Daily Limitation (IADL), and 10.1 percent use assistive devices for physical disabilities.</p>
<p>This year, Dream Sparks Foundation has been exploring the intersectionality of age with various factors, including gender and disability. Dream Sparks Foundation launched a research report titled &#8220;Women &amp; Ageing: Invisible or Empowered?&#8221; to shed light on the vulnerabilities experienced by older women. Women who are older and disabled face heightened vulnerability, particularly regarding mental impairments. Disparities in healthcare access, education, and caregiving responsibilities throughout a woman&#8217;s life compound these complexities, making them more susceptible to disabilities in older age.</p>
<p>In terms of policy and legal frameworks, India has the National Policy on Older Persons (NPOP) 1999, which aims to ensure the welfare and well-being of older individuals. While not explicitly mentioning older persons with disabilities, the NPOP addresses the unique challenges, emphasizing social inclusion, economic security, healthcare, and accessible infrastructure of all older persons.</p>
<p>The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, is the critical legislation that promotes the full participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of life. However, it falls short in addressing the specific challenges faced by older persons with disabilities. The Act lacks explicit provisions for older individuals, doesn&#8217;t sufficiently cover age-related disabilities, and doesn&#8217;t address the unique accessibility needs of older people. Moreover, it doesn&#8217;t outline targeted programs for older persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for greater inclusivity in policies, systems, and community activities, especially concerning older persons with disabilities. As our population ages, the intersection of age and disability becomes increasingly significant. To ensure their well-being and full participation in society, it is crucial that policies and systems consider the unique needs of this demographic group. This involves creating age-inclusive policies that address age-related disabilities, enhancing healthcare services tailored to older persons, and promoting community activities that foster social engagement and support networks, and technology that can develop assistive technologies, enhance accessibility, and create innovative solutions that promote independence and quality of life. Highlighting their active participation in various aspects of society, from education and employment to hobbies and community involvement, can help break down stereotypes and foster a culture of respect and inclusion for older individuals with disabilities. By taking proactive steps to include and empower older persons with disabilities, we can build a more inclusive and compassionate society that values the contributions and dignity of all its members.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>A call to address the neglect of the fastest growing demographic category</u></strong></p>
<p>Senior citizens are undoubtedly the fastest growing population segment of our society. With the advancements in healthcare coupled with increasing longevity and reducing mortality rates, the proportion of senior citizens are growing by leaps and bounds. Their number stood at about 100 million, 8% of the overall population, in 2017, and grew to 10.5% in 2022.  This trend of increasing proportion of elderly is likely to continue over decades, and would reach 20.8% in 2050 and 36% by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Yet, this alarming rate of rising elderly population, is not being reflected in the way the system responds to it. It has been quite a few years since a lay person has heard or seen any news in any of the media regarding any new welfare scheme being announced for the benefit of senior citizens. Neither is any old scheme being resurfaced for review, except for the recent news of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 being amended, which also did not happen.</p>
<p>India, which takes pride in being one of the fastest growing economies, should ideally reflect its economic growth through the social welfare and upliftment of all sections of the population, being a welfare state. However, the fact that the resources are not being utilised effectively for the welfare of the most significant segment of senior citizens is unfortunate.</p>
<p>The system and its functioning is youth-centric. The measures are targeted at them, as they are considered as economic assets. Meanwhile, the ageist perceptions which prevails around senior citizens being economically less productive is very depressing. This is being affixed to the overall perception of senior citizens as a burden to the state and its resources.</p>
<p>The major concern is about ensuring the financial well-being of the senior citizens. Despite the utmost need, nothing much has been highlighted regarding the economic welfare.  In fact, certain measures targeted at their welfare have been overridden in the name of COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rates on the Fixed and Savings account of the senior citizens have been declining.</li>
<li>Rail and air travel concessions that were previously available for senior citizens had been revoked, which needs to be brought back immediately.</li>
<li>The increasing rate of inflation and higher expenses is creating dents on the limited budgets of senior citizens.</li>
<li>There’s a noticeable shortage in the number of old age homes, and the conditions of those older persons who do not have any pension to rely on are very distressing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these issues is essential to uphold the dignity and well-being of the senior citizens who have contributed significantly to our society.</p>
<p>Our country has always upheld a profound respect and consideration for its senior citizens. Within our homes, older parents are revered, and throughout our public spaces, from buses to trains, planes, banks, hospitals, and countless other facilities, they are accorded priority.</p>
<p>Senior citizens represent an invaluable segment of our country. They have dedicated their lives to our nation, contributing their economic services and resources as responsible citizens, fulfilling their social responsibilities and they deserve to be in the minds of our wise planners. Let us remember the importance of recognizing their immense contributions and ensuring their well-being as a fundamental duty for society and our government.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Women, Ageing and Abuse</u></strong></p>
<p>Looking at the title you must be assuming that it would be about violence in the lives of women with maybe the nuance of age added to it. The reaction of men and women to this may vary. If you are a man, you may think I know it all, I have read it all. Anyway, I love and value all the females in my life even those who I know remotely. They are all happy as can be. What more could there be to it? So, why spend 10 minutes on this. If you are a woman, you probably live it so what is there to read?</p>
<p>Let me make an effort to entice you to read this piece. We all know that females hold 50% of the sky in the world and get 150% attention in macro forums and documents and all other places that are fancy, where the high and mighty are found. But, in reality—that is closer to the ground where commoners like you and me are found—each day is another struggle for men and women. Where the complexities of life have to be grappled with each day to make it work. In that grime and dirt does it help being a female or does it make it even harder. Does age add another layer and dimension of challenges or makes it easier? After all, at least in India we love and respect our elders more so the ‘mother’ most commonly used to address older women. Does this reveal or conceal the reality?</p>
<p>Let us look at this a little more closely. ‘Mother’ is one who is makes sacrifices for comfort of her children. No big deal. She is self-effacing. She gives up her well-paying job or career to take care of her children. No big deal. She makes heavy emotional investment in children. No big deal. After all that her primary responsibility. She is not doing anything unusual or heroic. Do you agree?  If yes, please continue to read.</p>
<p>The typical trajectory in the life of a mother. When her children are small, they are dependent on her, their world revolves around her. She is the most important person in their lives without whom they may not be able to do much. As they become adolescent, she is likely to become the ‘helicopter’ mom.  A little later, nothing but a meddling person who has nothing of her own to keep busy. Lastly, she becomes an unbearable burden to be off-loaded in various ways, the most stark being: neglected in her own house, abandoned in an institution or in one of the holy cities. Actually, she does not have the intelligence to know when and where to stop treating her children as children. There is certainly a ‘father’ in the background trying to rationalise all this for her. For he also believes that she did her job well.</p>
<p>But you may very well counter question me and ask, an overwhelming majority of ‘mothers’ still live with their adult children. Many of them still have the house registered in their names. They are many a times joint account holders. Many retire with a good pension or assets. Families rush to help them, as and when they ask. Many may think that what is more fulfilling for a woman than seeing her children do well in life, irrespective of whether they acknowledge her contribution or not. Really?</p>
<p>That is where we are looking for the intersection on women, ageing and abuse. That which is so normalised, that we don’t even feel the pinch. For in real life when the ‘mother’ is old, without income or economic security, without much education, unable to traverse the digital world, unable to keep pace with the changing social norms in the world, she becomes irrelevant and quietly neglected if not outrightly abandoned.</p>
<p>I can also quote facts and figures to let you know how many are facing these challenges. But would be happy if you on your own try to find out about this in India and the world. Also not stop at that, but look around yourself and make the change, and encourage the women around you to be individuals too. Encourage your workplaces to ensure that women employees who take career breaks for family responsibilities be given some encouragement to reskill, rejoin and continue to contribute to social security funds and health insurance.</p>
<p>With increasing longevity of women, it is important for us to change this scenario and create an enabling environment for women to thrive. After all, if those who hold 50% of the sky are impoverished, abused and uneducated, the rest 50% will have to take on more load!</p>
