				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rahibai Soma Popere, aged 53 years living in <em>Kombhalne</em> village at Ahmednagar, Maharashtra was one of the chosen women for the inspiring Nari Shakti Award by Government of India. She was married at the age of 13 years and settled in same village. She has not received any formal education from school in her childhood but had a strong desire to do something for the society and for her family.  She lives with her husband, has three sons a daughter; all are married and settled in different locations. All her children are involved in farming. One of her son is a Photographer and earns little income from his profession. Rahibai’s family does seasonal farming because of lack of irrigational facilities in her village. There is no other source of income to her family except meager income through farming.</p>
<p>There is only one government sub center at Poperwadi village which provides health care for local people.  Presently Dream Sparks Foundation’s MHU operates at Poperwadi village which offers extremely useful <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development/mobile-healthcare">healthcare service</a> for the locals at the last mile, right at their door step. Rahibai is taking health treatment since 4 years for back ache, burning feet, joint pain, renal colic, acute respiratory infection and giddiness.  Our MHU service was very much helpful for Mrs Rahibai and her family members.  Today she is active in the family and supports to her family members in all possible way, so much so, that her brilliantly inspirational service to the community has won her a national honor! <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> takes extreme pride in Rahibai’s achievement!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2670" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img1.jpg" alt="Self Help Groups (SHGS) for women" width="1000" height="373" srcset="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img1.jpg 1000w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img1-300x112.jpg 300w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img1-768x286.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>She has initiated two Self Help Groups (SHGS) for women.  One of them is Chemdevbaba Women’s Self Help Group &amp; other one is Mangalnath Baba Women’s Self Help Group. Both SHGs have 12 members each and actively organize various social activities. These SHGs started agro based activities and one of them is to preserve the traditional agricultural seeds (Seed Bank). This initiative proved much beneficial in agricultural sector and for local government agencies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2671" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img2.jpg" alt="varieties of seeds available in Mrs Rahibai's home" width="1000" height="281" srcset="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img2.jpg 1000w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img2-300x84.jpg 300w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img2-768x216.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>There are 114 varieties of seeds available in Mrs Rahibai’s home. All these are <strong>Gavran seeds</strong> (Traditional Seeds). Most of the farmers nowadays are involved in chemical based fertilizer farming and traditional varieties of seeds are losing relevance in the markets and farming communities.  In this scenario Rahibai’s initiative of establishing seed bank was much appreciated by various key stakeholders and leaders of the community.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2672" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img3.jpg" alt="Rahibai Soma Popere’s recognized for her work in agriculture sector and in Women SHGs" width="1000" height="526" srcset="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img3.jpg 1000w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img3-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-img3-768x404.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>In order to recognize Rahibai Soma Popere’s work in agriculture sector and in Women SHGs including Seed Bank in Kombhalne village in Akole Taluka of Ahmednagar, the District administration recommended her name to be felicitated with <strong>“ Narishakti “ Award from Honorable President of India Shri Ramnath Kovind on the occasion of “International Women’s Day 2019”. She received the honor from the President of India and also had the opportunity to discuss her initiatives with him.</strong></p>
<p>Dream Sparks Foundation warmly congratulates Rahibai Soma Popere for this big achievement and also  salutes Khirwire <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development/mobile-healthcare">Mobile Healthcare</a> team who made sure for all these years her health was taken care of, with help of free medicines and treatment so that she could carry on some path-breaking work for India’s farming sector.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine’s Day is celebrated on 14th February, across the world every year. The day is named after Saint Valentine or celebrated as the Feast of Saint Valentine. It celebrates his efforts in recognizing and encouraging love between people, companions, even those forbidden by society. On this day of love people across the world are known to profess their love by making their loved ones feel special, by gifting cards, bouquets, and gifts to each other. The day was predominantly celebrated in western countries, but with commercialization and increase in online communication, the world has become smaller and it is therefore now celebrated at a much larger scale across the globe.</p>
<p>When we talk of love, we often picture young teens and young adults confessing their love, but there is no age for love, for love has no limits. Age is just a number. Valentine’s Day is a celebration of love across all ages and can be celebrated with anyone you love, your friends, parents and grandparents. It is important in times like these, to remind yourself how lucky you are to have the unquestionable love of your parents &amp; grandparents with you and use this opportunity to show them you care by spending quality time with them, making them feel special. It could be sitting down with them and helping them reminiscence about the love of their life or share memories of fun times, or simply take them out for a treat or gift them something special or even give them a nice tight hug.</p>
<p>You can celebrate this day with your grandparents by doing what they did when they were young or if they have any particular tradition like, going out for a movie, or you can pick out their favorite movie or simply celebrate the day surrounded by family. There are other ways you can celebrate this day with your grandparents and elders at home by cooking their favorite meal or doing fun activity with them  the idea is to appreciate them and make them feel a part of your world and also show them they are valued and cherished. If you know any elders who live in your area-, be sure to call or visit them so that they don’t feel alone of left out.</p>
<p>Grandparents share a special bond with their grandchildren. They are known for unconditional love and unwavering commitment for their grandchildren and they never miss an opportunity to connect and spend time with the little ones. Grandparents are essential members of our family and our childhood. Our childhood memories are filled with moments not only with our parents but also our grandparents who also have had an important role in our upbringing and growth. Our memories are filled with their presence, be it birthdays, summer holidays, festivals or special occasions. It is nostalgic when you hear their stories about how they met their better half, or how our country was some sixty to seventy years back. It is a major learning for us when we get to listen to their life experiences and worth seeing their eyes light up with excitement or their face breaking into a smile, giving you a glimpse of their younger self. It is in moments like these that you understand the value of being alive and also grateful for sharing these moments with your grandparents. You value the knowledge behind those wise wrinkled eyes, you cherish the time you have with them because you know life is short and opportunities with your parents and grandparents should not be missed.</p>
<p>This is what we need to celebrate on Valentine’s Day, the gifts and cards can never really capture what exists in our hearts. It is a day to remember and value those who have spent their time taking care of us and making us their world. Life takes its own course sometimes. In the beginning, we are too busy exploring the world and our place in it, then work and family life takes over and as we grow older, we begin to slow down and our focus gradually moves inward. Our elders teach us that love is always there, but often ignored, readily available but not appreciated. The lesson is to return to the basic truth of what remains when everything passes by or falls away. When we allow love to infuse in our life, miracles happen. Next time, an older people passes you, just pay attention to them and give them your time, for that is invaluable.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/age-does-not-protect-you-from-love-but-love-protects-you-from-age-jeanne-moreau/">“Age does not protect you from love, but love protects you from age” – Jeanne Moreau</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is a time of cheer. A time of giving and sharing but most of all, it&#8217;s a time of year when you forget about everything and spend time with your children, friends, and parents. There is nothing more joyful and heartwarming than spending quality time with people you love, curling up in blankets with a hot cup of coffee or sitting by the fireplace listening to stories shared by your grandparents or just having warm conversations with your friends.</p>
<p>As this year comes to an end, it is important not to forget what this season stands for, the joy of Christmas giving.  As we prepare for holidays and festivities and look forward to spending good time with family and friends, we must not forget those less fortunate than us who probably don&#8217;t even have basic necessities like food, clothes, and shelter to keep them protected during the harsh winters.</p>
<p>It is a sad state of affairs that there are so many <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development/old-age-homes">homeless elders</a> in our country who have been left out in the cold, deserted and disowned by their own families. All those who are surrounded by parents and grandparents, you are truly blessed. It will only take a minute to make a difference in the life of an elder, to bring a smile on their faces by spending this Christmas with them.</p>
<p>So this Christmas, let&#8217;s put a smile and cheer on the faces of our elderly and bring warmth in their life. For those who wish to eliminate the suffering of those less fortunate, any amount is appreciated, it doesn&#8217;t have to be big or small. Christmas is in your heart; the spirit of Christmas is alive all around us. All we need is to share.</p>
<p>&#8220;He who has not Christmas in his heart will never find it under a tree.&#8221;  &#8211; Roy L. Smith</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/a-good-conscience-is-a-continual-christmas-benjamin-franklin/">“A good conscience is a continual Christmas.” – Benjamin Franklin</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A 20-year Dream Sparks Foundation’s intern from Yes Foundation Fellows Network, narrates her bottled up memories in this heart-warming blog. Read Amaya Philips’ story.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how many sleepless nights my <em>Appa</em> might have spent drenched in sweat from heat and worries, while I slept soundly as a little girl. Only when once, I had to sleep in a hot room with sweat rolling down my body, was when I realised how uncomfortable it was. Whereas my father almost always slept in heat so that my sister and I could have access to fan-breeze in the night in our room. I know how much my father and mother have sacrificed for us. My <em>Appa</em> has been a good son who took great care of his parents and fulfilled all his duties with the support of my <em>Amma</em> in all the troubles and happiness, with the same peaceful balance in his heart, at all times.</p>
<p>He always said<strong>,” <em>Do not forget anyone who has helped you at any point in your life. They have helped you, not because you asked them to, but because they wanted to. Whenever sometime in future you stand on your feet, help them. Perhaps they won’t ask for your help but when they need you, you should be there.”</em> </strong>My father didn&#8217;t tell me how to live; he simply lived, and let me watch him do it.</p>
<p>One thing I can tell you for sure is that nothing in this world replaces our own Maa, my dearest <em>Amma</em>. There is an unsaid bond of umbilical cord between the mother and the baby which exists even when the umbilical cord is cut and the baby is born. It was only her, who patiently listened to my foolish blabberings as a toddler. It’s not for nothing, that for most of us, the first word which comes out of our mouth when we are in trouble is <em>Amma.</em><strong>  </strong>She is a daughter, wife, mother, teacher, friend, cook, detective (who searches and finds out our missing things!) and above all a great listener. For me, <em>Amma</em> is one who understands her children more than anyone else in this world.</p>
<p>There is nobody I’ve come to trust more than my parents.  I can say anything frankly to them. I do not fear being judged by them, whereas everyone else at some point or the other has had an ‘opinion’ about me. My parents, however, have always been so busy loving me, that they’ve never had the time to judge me. They’ve always only unconditionally “given”. That’s why they always say,<strong> “We live only for you.”</strong>  One day in my life perhaps, I’ll say the same to my children.</p>
<p>This summer, I am working at Dream Sparks Foundation, a <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">charity in India</a>, which fights for the rights of the <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/rights-entitlements-programs">disadvantaged elderly</a>. As a granddaughter, daughter, sister and above all as an individual, I feel so proud to be a part of this effort in a tiny way, which stands against the monster of elder abuse. The postivity, jubilation and the pleasure that I got when I heard the words from the elders during my interaction at eye camps, digital literacy workshops that I conducted with my fellow interns, have all been captured as delightful memories forever. I’ve learnt empathy and service for destitute elders in a way like never before. I urge all young people to volunteer for organizations like HelpAge, because only when you witness such moments, is when you will understand the essence of it. The blessings the elders gave, the smiles they had, the energy they showed were mesmerising. I am so grateful to Dream Sparks Foundation and Yes Foundation for giving me this opportunity.</p>
<p>Let’s try to give the respect and care that the elderly deserve. My <em>Naani </em>once said to me<em>,<strong> “Till the time we have eyes, we don’t realize their value but once they’re gone everything will be dark. Parents are like that. Respect them.”</strong></em> It is true, that when they get old they lose their patience, listening power but so will we, when we get old.  I often wonder how much of care, or of help would I be able to give to my parents in the future. After all, I too am a part of the so called &#8220;new generation&#8221;, with its fast paced smartphone dependent lives that is blamed to be the reason for the growing generation gap on one side, but are encouraged to be the reason for growing technology on the other side. But as a 20-year-old educated individual, I believe that it&#8217;s better to put my thoughts into action than mere words. The world is changing, so should we. The least I urge is every young person to start looking up from their phones and start listening to elders with empathy, when they talk to us. Trust me, that’s a good enough start. Volunteer at <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development/old-age-homes">old age homes</a>, help your old parents, grandparents file their income tax returns before July 31<sup>st</sup>, greet them with happiness and love, hold their hands when you talk to them, sit and have tea with them, it all adds up. Every drop counts. Every ounce of care counts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to tell you a little story that I heard about a week and a half ago. A story of a mother, just like mine and your’s.</p>
<p>This summer of 2018, I’ve joined an organisation called <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a>, working to empower the <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/rights-entitlements-programs">disadvantaged elderly</a>. On the very first day of my internship, I thought to myself of how HelpAge must have been helping elders who have lost their family in some tragedy, who have no one on this planet, no family and no friends. Little did I know, that there are parents out there who have been left to die, assaulted, abused and beaten up by their own blood. I heard the story of a mother who was pushed from a rooftop just for loving her children too much, just for living with them and just because she was a dependent. Her son couldn’t take her compassion anymore. She perhaps was now a burden. She was thought to be a trouble to the home, a home that she built. This was one of the moments where my heart sank. I saw the media coverage on YouTube about the story. I researched more and my helplessness only grew more. It was not just empathy, I can assure you about that. It was much more. It was her sense of belief which was betrayed by her own son, that made me lose my belief in the world for a moment. Within moments to follow next, I put my thoughts together and strived to do something more about it.</p>
<p>As a young person, am very active on social media, especially Instagram. I have about 4500 followers. I have now decided to reach out to more young people through the power of Instagram stories and build advocacy on the issue. I’ll be at the Parliament street on 15<sup>th</sup> June, 2018 with my friends instagramming live, through the power of my smartphone, to mark the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day with the Dream Sparks Foundation team. Will you join me to help advocate for a world that is sensitive to it’s elderly and promotes love, dignity and empowerment in their lives? Let’s come together to fight abuse, loneliness and neglect in their lives.</p>
<p>For the next one month, I’ll be interning with Dream Sparks Foundation at the Delhi office, helping in the Communications and Advocacy team to amplify their efforts and build a more inclusive world for our destitute elders.</p>
