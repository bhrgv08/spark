				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“<em>If you&#8217;re saving, you&#8217;re succeeding.</em>”― Steve Burkholder</p>
<p>India with a population of 106 million elders and a majority of this population is not covered under any formal retirement income scheme. With demographic challenges, there is a large population of elders that do not work, and as life expectancy increases, financial planning for senior citizens is imperative. Planning your retirement and ensuring a steady income for later years is important for economic freedom and overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>Retirement is a major turning point in an individual’s life and it mostly means focusing on getting a steady and regular flow of income while keeping tax liability at bay. However, in India, the age of retirement is sixty years whereas life expectancy can be stretched to eighty years and above. Therefore, it is very important for elders to do proper financial planning and investment, to be able to take care of the monthly expenses and have a strong financial resource.</p>
<p>To ensure personal wellbeing and independence in old age, it is very important to have a regular flow of income post-retirement. To ensure financial freedom, it is important to invest your savings in low-risk schemes with good returns. Mostly, elders prefer not to invest in highly volatile market schemes and prefer safer options while trying to make major financial investments.</p>
<p>Before we look at the Investment options, it is necessary to understand the risks involved and the returns generated on these investments. Therefore, it is important to keep a few things in mind, like Investing in schemes that guarantee steady cash flow, generate good income and are low risk, while also giving varied options of investment.</p>
<p>There are few Investment Options listed for senior citizens to lead an independent life. Planning your retirement and investing in schemes that provide good income will also provide protection against future uncertain events and illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Citizens’ Savings Scheme (SCSS)</strong></p>
<p>The Senior Citizen Scheme is available for the seniors at the post office and banks, having a five-year tenure which can also be stretched to three years as the scheme matures. The rate of interest is 8.6% p.a, which is taxable and can be paid quarterly. The maximum amount deposited could be as high as fifteen lakhs and a person is entitled to open more than one account enjoying tax benefits as well and can withdraw the money prematurely when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS)</strong></p>
<p>The Post Office Monthly Scheme provides a 7.8% p. a. rate of interest and is paid monthly. The maximum amount invested could be nine lakhs and can be opened by a single account holder or joint account with a spouse or a relative. The scheme doesn’t provide any tax benefits and the interest is directly transferred into the savings account of the account holder.</p>
<p>Mutual Funds are subjected to market risks and therefore it is advisable to protect yourself by investing a certain percentage into equity mutual funds and large capital and balanced funds as these are more stable and reliable and ensures to keep the monthly income flowing.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Deposits</strong></p>
<p>Most elders invest in fixed deposits as they consider is safe and lucrative, however, they have low returns and prone to inflation and market fluctuations on interest rates and don’t provide good tax benefits.</p>
<p><strong>National Pension System</strong></p>
<p>National Pension System enables elders to invest in equity and debt funds and ensure a steady income. It is an initiative by the Indian government and was introduced in the year 2004, and allows individuals to invest a portion of their salary in equity and debt funds. The eligibility criteria are eighteen to seventy years and pay annuity income every month post-retirement.</p>
<p><strong>National Savings Certificates (NSC)</strong></p>
<p>National Savings Certificates is issued by Post Office and are like fixed deposits offering 8% returns for a fixed 5-year term. The interest is reinvested until it’s matured and is given along with the investment amount. The savings made under this scheme are exempted from tax.</p>
<p>The ideal financial investment for senior citizens should provide a balance between both revenue and growth, and also the prerequisite of the individual. For elders who are getting a pension from their employers may not need a steady inflow of cash but need more growth and revenue-generating schemes. However, those who are self- employed or working in an unorganized sector may not be getting pensions at all and therefore require schemes and investment that will provide and ensure a steady income every month.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/financial-planning-for-senior-citizens/">Financial planning for Senior Citizens</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian market is finally ready for some powerful investments by introducing Social Stock Exchange as mentioned in the Budget of 2019. The anticipated exchanges will be controlled by SEBI and will allow the listing of social enterprises and voluntary establishments by creating an electronic fundraising platform to raise capital, debt and mutual funds. The Finance Minister said <em>“it is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial inclusion”. </em></p>
<p>KYC norms will be eased to encourage foreign investors and steps will be taken to bring equity market closer to people, thereby allowing establishments working for health, transportation and environment through this platform.  In layman’s term, a social stock exchange is a platform that allows investors to procure shares in social organizations that has been evaluated by the exchange. The Finance Minister added <em>“Rupees 350 crore has been allocated for 2 per cent interest subvention for all GST-registered MSMEs on fresh or incremental loans.”</em></p>
<p>There are few exchanges globally, like the London Stock Exchange, SASIX in South Africa and Singapore’s Impact Investment Exchange, which allows social enterprises, volunteer groups and welfare organizations working in areas of environment, transportation and health to raise risk capital. The Social Stock Exchange will be an ingenious way to include the public in participating in social cause through the equity route. The Social Stock Exchange will be under the supervisory influence of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and would empower social enterprises to raise capital via equity, debt or in the form of units like a mutual fund.</p>
<p><strong>A Social Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>A social enterprise is a profit generating business and its main objective is to achieve its social and even though its primary goal is not about making profits, it ensures the sustainability of the organization. A social organization can be very successful and most of them operate like traditional businesses however, the profits generated by these enterprises are not used as a payout to the investors but instead it is reinvested in the programs run and managed by the organizations.  A successful social organization keeps the profits’ flowing which in turn helps them in executing their long term programs and also include the right technology and professionals to associate with them and their cause.  It is profits that differentiate a social organization from charities that are totally dependent on donations.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Investment</strong></p>
<p>Investments made with an aim to make quantifiable social, economic and environmental impression and also generating profit and publicity. Currently, impact Investment sector is growing in India which means that investments will also increase. </p>
<p>Social Stock Exchange will act as a platform to bring social organizations and impact investors together where investors will be able to buy shares in the form of bonds from the listed organizations whose mission may align to that of the investor’s interests. The value of these social organizations listed on the exchange will be linked to their social impact. </p>
<p>Social startups often find it difficult to raise funds through angel and venture capital investors, unlike regular technology startups. The scale of its success cannot be measured or assessed for near future since it is more about the nature of impact and not acquiring users through discounts etc. Since investors look for successful business models to validate their investments, investing in social startups becomes a little difficult because of the nature of the market. However, listing on an exchange makes up for a viable option for the social startups looking for funding and capital. Nirmala Sitharaman in her maiden budget speech proposed <em>“an electronic fundraising platform – a social stock exchange” for listing social enterprises and voluntary organizations “working for the realization of a social welfare objective so that they can raise capital as equity, debt or as units like a mutual fund.”</em></p>
<p>The listings on Social Stock Exchange will be monitored regularly to promote competition and encourage discipline. The securities of the top social organization will carry a premium and the ones that lack in efficiency will be penalized. Establishing Social Stock Exchange will not only help the growing investment market but also a more regulated capital market in India which will be managed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. </p>
<p>Social Stock Exchange will help impact investment to become more accessible which will increase the flow of money into sustainable developments thereby reducing the burden on the Government. This framework can also be an important channel for International development finance.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/social-stock-exchange-in-india/">Social Stock Exchange In India</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Central Government presented the Budget twice in the year 2019. First the interim Budget was presented in February and later a full budget was presented on July 5th. Both the budget includes tax related declarations which can influence personal finances.<br />
There are some tax reforms which have been done to achieve two goals; proving beneficial to the tax payers as well as boosting the real estate sector. Although tax rebate was hiked in the Interim Budget, they were high expectations that more relief would be given to tax payers to enhance savings, consumption and investments. However, the Finance Minister didn’t touch the tax slabs and rates for the senior citizens.</p>
<p>Nirmala Sitharaman in her speech proposed “an electronic fundraising platform – a social stock exchange” for listing social enterprises and voluntary organizations “working for the realization of a social welfare objective so that they can raise capital as equity, debt or as units like a mutual fund.” Social Organizations are playing a vital role in in solving problems related to health, finance and education and creating a Social Stock Exchange platform will help these organizations raise funds for the work they are doing.</p>
<p>The government announced a host of incentives to “release the entrepreneurial spirit” in the words of India’s first Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitaharaman. The government will be debut a TV program on national broadcaster Doordarshan, dedicated for startups, run and executed by startups. Simplification of foreign direct investment guidelines into startups divisions like e- commerce, grocery and food deliver. Offering a host of developments to the digital payments systems, ecosystems that would help tech startup, incentives for electric vehicles that would help EV startups and ensuring that startups do not feel the heat of angel tax from IT authorities. Though measures were announced for extending digital literacy to the furthest parts of the country and promise of proving power in the remotest of village remains a far-fetched thought, seniors struggle the most with digital payments.</p>
<p>The budget of 2019-20 did not mention anything about the National Social Assistance Program which provides income security to the disabled, widows and elders. Since the Central Government covers only 3.55 crore beneficiaries, 70 % of the population comprises of the widows, disabled and the elderly who will not be able to avail the benefits of the scheme. Mathew Cherian, CEO, Dream Sparks Foundation said “The miss given by Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, to the National Social Assistance Program from the Budget speech is extremely disappointing”.</p>
<p>Health Security is one of the most important aspects for the overall social protection of the elderly in the country. Under section 20 of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (MWPSC) Act of 2007, the states are required to provide one Geriatric Care Facility in every district and beds in all government hospitals was mandatory, yet there is no advancement seen in this regard. The objective of the National Program for Health and Care of Elderly (NPHCE) was launched nearly a decade ago and the demand to it still remains unmet.</p>
<p>The “Stand up India” scheme impelled in 2016 to fund and encourage women entrepreneurs and relegated sections of the society will be further protracted for the period of 2020-25. “To further encourage women entrepreneurship, Women SHG Interest Subvention Program to be expanded to all districts in India,” Sitharaman said during the budget speech.</p>
<p>Naari Tu Naraayani scheme focuses on how only one woman in every Self Help Group (SHG) will be made eligible for Rupees 1 lakh Mudra loan. This will benefit the younger women who are more active and the older women will not be able to avail the benefits of the scheme.<br />
The government will also set up 80 Livelihood business incubators and 20 tech business incubators which will aid in producing 75,000 skilled entrepreneurs in the agricultural industry sectors. The government also proposed 100% FDI in insurance intermediaries, and allowed 100% FDI in single brand retail and proposed removing 30% local sourcing norms.</p>
<p>The 2019 budget for New India forgot its senior citizens by a long margin, as they find themselves excluded once again. The expectations by the senior citizens from the Union Budget 2019 were high this times especially when the interest rates are falling and the medical inflation is on a high in India, but they have been massively let down by the budget constructs.</p>
<p>HelpAge is working with more than 6000 Senior Citizen Associations (SCAs) across India with over 10 lakh members. These elders are encouraged to become a unified voice raising elder concerns. HelpAge arranges awareness sessions on important issues like: old age pensions, reverse mortgage, financial planning, wills &amp; legacies, and of late concentrating on digital literacy training sessions.</p>
<p>HelpAge conducts ‘Digital Literacy’ program by introducing elders to the online world by conducting workshops across the country. Partner institutions, organizations, volunteers and interns are encouraged to conduct basic tutorials for elders, using the HelpAge Handbook for senior citizens – Computers and Smart Phones learning made easy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>While the middle class benefits to some extent, the destitute elder from the lower socio-economic strata has been left completely neglected.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Budget 2018 proposes some benefits for senior citizens, providing them tax benefits in healthcare and giving higher income from interest. However the extreme destitute poor elder neglected.</li>
<li>Interest of up to ₹50,000 earned on fixed deposits by senior citizens will be exempted from taxation as against ₹10,000 earlier. TDS will not be required to be deducted under section 194A and it has been extended to all fixed deposit schemes and recurring deposit schemes.</li>
<li>Income tax deduction limit on health insurance premium and medical expenditures incurred by senior citizens and senior citizens aged 80 and above, has been increased to ₹50,000 under Section 80D. This is significant as the number of people suffering from chronic ailments in this age bracket is significantly higher. But ironic however, is the point that middle class elderly who are pressured by medical expenses are exactly the ones who do not have a medical insurance policy in the first place! So this move, is only going to benefit a niche section &#8211; those who pay tax and those who have insurance.</li>
<li>For individuals who are below 60 years of age, no change has been proposed. The deduction under section 80D for them continues to be Rs25,000. This includes deduction on account of preventive health check-up up to Rs5,000.</li>
<li>Expenses incurred on critical illness by senior citizens will be exempted up to ₹1 lakh. Earlier it was ₹60,000 for senior citizens and ₹80,000 for very old senior citizens.</li>
<li>Extension of the <em>Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana</em> (PMVVY) up to March 2020 under which an assured return of 8 per cent is given by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The existing limit on investment of ₹5 lakh per senior citizen under this scheme is also being doubled to ₹15 lakh. (The PMVVY scheme can be purchased offline as well as online, through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which has been given the sole rights to operate it.)</li>
<li>This Union Budget, the Govt. has empowered country’s senior citizens with <strong>more power to invest. </strong>So, a middle class couple, both senior citizens, can invest up to ₹15 lakh separately, or maximum Rs. 30 lakh by putting together in the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) scheme and can earn an interest of ₹49 lakh a year from it.</li>
<li>The <em>Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana</em> (PMVVY) scheme is at par with other schemes for senior citizens such as Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, which offers a similar return of 8.3% per annum currently. In the current falling interest rate scenario, fixed 8.3% annual return is a good option.</li>
<li>Though there are some beneficial sops for the middle class elder, there is still much left desired vis a vis the poor elder, particularly in the area of <strong>old age pension</strong>, which <strong>finds no mention in the budget at all</strong>. Currently the contribution from Government of India to old age pension is a meager  Rs.200/- per month, <em>(<a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> for about a decade, has been advocating an increase in old age pension for the elderly, to at least amounting to Rs.2000/- per month as Universal Pension across India, which seems absolutely neglected).</em> So while the middle class benefits to some extent, the destitute elder from the lower socio-economic strata has been left completely by the sidelines.</li>
<li>According to the 2011 census, among the 103 million elderly citizens, 70 million are from the lower strata. For these people, the finance minister has announced a medical insurance cover. But medical insurance isn&#8217;t what they need as much as they desperately need a pension <em>first</em>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>RBI directs all banks to provide doorstep banking to those above 70 by 31<sup>st</sup> Dec. 2017</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;">Information from the Press Trust of India wire</p>
<p>Senior citizens of more than 70 years of age and the differently-abled can look forward to availing of basic banking services, right from the comfort of their home.</p>
<p>The RBI on 9<sup>th</sup> Nov. 2017, asked banks to provide doorstep banking facilities to senior citizens of more than 70 years of age and differently-abled persons by 31<sup>st</sup> December this year.</p>
<p>Banks have been directed that senior citizens and specially-abled persons, including the visually-impaired, should be provided basic services like pick-up and delivery of cash, cheque books and demand drafts at their residence.</p>
<p>Issuing a notification in this regard, the RBI said &#8220;<em>it has been observed</em>&#8221; that there are occasions when banks discourage or turn away senior citizens and differently-abled persons from availing banking facilities in branches.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230; in view of the difficulties faced by senior citizens of more than 70 years of age and differently-abled or infirm persons (having medically certified chronic illness or disability) including those who are visually impaired, banks are advised to make concerted effort to provide basic banking facilities</em>&#8230;,&#8221; the RBI said in a communication to banks, including small finance and payments banks.</p>
<p><strong>These facilities should include pick-up of cash and instruments against receipt, delivery of cash against withdrawal from accounts, delivery of demand drafts, and submission of Know Your Customer (KYC) documents and Life Certificates at the premises or residence of such customers.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Banks are advised to implement these instructions by 31<sup>st</sup> December, 2017, in letter and spirit and give due publicity in their bank branches and websites,&#8221;</em> it said.</p>
<p>The RBI noted that notwithstanding the need to push digital transactions and use of ATMs, it is imperative to be sensitive to the requirements of senior citizens and the differently-abled.</p>
