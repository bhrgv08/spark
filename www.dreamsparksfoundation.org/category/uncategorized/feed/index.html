<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why the post-pandemic retiree is choosing freedom over family</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the toughest tests we have faced as a collective but the most severely impacted were senior citizens. As the most vulnerable segment of the population, they lived under virtual curfew for months, some even for years. All their daily activities such as buying their daily requirements of food and medicines, meeting relatives and friends living, not socialize, or visiting places of worship, etc. were brought to a halt and every day was filled with uncertainty, despondency and isolation. They remained cooped up in their surroundings and suffered both mentally and physically. Even before the pandemic, several surveys and reports about the living conditions of senior citizens had revealed an increasing prevalence of abuse at the hands of their own family members, especially their own children. The stressful situation of being confined with the same families 24X7 with no respite, increasing financial pressures and lack of emotional support, led to a rise in physical, emotional and verbal elder abuse. The only way out seemed to be to break the shackles and move out of the status quo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this connection, the ‘new crop of retiring persons’, i.e. those who achieved seniority recently and retired have been active in bucking the trend and taking lead to seek independence from the old system of living with their children as dependents. What has helped them to take this initiative was some sound financial decisions during their employment years, which has led to a level of financial stability, independence and security. Some of these retirees received handsome handouts at the time of retirement like pension funds, gratuity, encashment of accumulated leave, travel expenses, medical benefits, etc. Others have benefited from investments in Insurance, Mutual Funds and other stocks and shares options, which have empowered them to be able to take their own life decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This group of empowered retirees is now choosing to escape from ‘suppressed’ living and seek out the many options of independent senior citizens’ housing, whether through rent or purchase, depending on their requirements. An increasing number of senior living centres have sprung up in both Metro and Satellite towns, which give very clear options at varying costs for the senior citizens to suit their pockets. These establishments have all the facilities like cooking, washing, housekeeping, medical and nursing help, security, entertainment, indoor and outdoor games, transport, travel – all ‘inhouse’ so that there are no hassles of any kind and everything is taken care of. Thus, they can seek to live as per their wishes, maintaining their own standards, free of interference and avoiding bickering with their family members to truly be able to live ‘happily ever after’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is good that senior citizens with means of their own are able to make the difficult decision to choose independence over life with their family it is surely a cause for alarm as well. The disintegration of the family structure is bound to eventually lead to the disintegration of society as a whole. The pandemic has been a wake-up call to us in many ways where we have all had a chance to reassess our priorities and fix broken systems. It may be a good idea for us to pay attention now to the fissures within our own homes that may need fixing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gifting Sight to Disadvantaged Elders with Dream Sparks Foundation’s ‘Aankhon Ka Tara’ Campaign</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Imagine a health problem which has causes that are 90% treatable, the solution is widely available and cost effective, and yet millions suffer and struggle on daily basis. Avoidable blindness/visual impairment is a significant public health problem in India. This is particularly serious in the age group of 50 plus, where 1 in 4 are visually impaired (varying degree of severity). This age group has 5X risk compared to adult population in general. As per the ‘National Blindness &amp;amp; Visual Impairment Survey’, more than 10 million are affected by blindness or severe vision impairment, and three times more have varying degrees of impairment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what is particularly striking is that both cataract (clouding of eye lens) and refraction error, the two important causes responsible for 90% of avoidable cases, are easily addressable. The other reasons are due to more complex conditions relating to cornea issues, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well established technological and medical solutions are there for both. Cataract is treated through simple surgery costing about Rs 2500-3000 (cost at non-profit centres for social purpose; higher at others). Eyeglasses/spectacles costing about Rs 500 has been seen as one of the most impactful inventions and many of us, who are using them would testify to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why are millions then not able to access clear eyesight? The reasons are linked to social and economic vulnerability. People without formal education are at 6X risk, since awareness is low and misconceptions are high. The other key barrier is linked to affordability, i.e. income or livelihoods. For most working in the informal sector and earning low wages, even Rs 500-2500 is difficult to afford and most tend to keep postponing it. Instead, they put up with the daily struggle and for some life comes to a stop. Think about the farm worker who is half as productive, a rickshaw puller who is unable to work, or a tailor who struggles to get work done, or a situation closer to the family/social context – a grandmother who is unable to see the smile on her children and grandchildren’s faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vision is a gift and blessing, but sadly many are not fortunate and suffer simply due to lack of access. Clear vision has become a privilege. Diwali is a time of lights, where we may appreciate this blessing even more. The campaign ‘Aankhon Ka Tara’ (star of my eyes) is an effort to bridge this gap by encouraging all of us to become the star for someone else who is underprivileged, by bringing light into their lives and help them get clear vision for a better quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine, you’re in the year 1995, back when phones had keypads where you had to press the same key thrice to type a particular letter. You wake up to 122 messages out of which 100 are from the telecom companies and 22 are from your contacts. You can only reply to one message at a time. There was no WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook. Now, imagine pressing the same set of keys multiple times because you have to reply to all 22 messages from friends and family separately. Feels like a lot of work, doesn’t it? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s take this one step further. What if you don’t have the knowledge of the alphabets or numbers that you  see on your keypad? Confusing? What if you want to contact your family but you need help from someone else to dial the numbers or type texts for you because it’s all so new and different to you and you have no idea how it works?, Day-to-day life may become a bit complicated, wouldn’t it? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s surprising how sometimes when you go to a new place, meet new people or experience something so different and yet so familiar, you may come across an issue that you were aware of but see it in a whole new light. . </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I faced one such experience recently, when I was reminded of how there are many people, especially senior citizens, who struggle with the use of technology. I had seen my grandmother face similar issues, but in all honestly, after I lost her around three years ago, it is an issue that I had forgotten about. And this is actually a problem with everybody in my generation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generations after generations have come to be comfortable with the use of smartphones and gadgets and yet there are still many people in our country, who are struggling to keep up with the digital world.  Even today, there are many senior citizens, especially those belonging to the lower middle class section of society, who have not been touched by digital developments and in many cases, do not have even the basic level of education that is required by a person to stay up-to-date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the years when my grandmother was with us, I closely saw her struggling with new age technology, be it cell phones, smartphones, smart TVs, etc.. From finding it difficult to recognise the English numerals on the older phones to struggling with understanding the latest smart devices, I’d seen her find her way through it as we helped her along the way. We saw her understanding, learning and even discovering on her own at a later stage. But over a period of time after she left us, it sort of got wiped away from my mind that many elders still struggle with similar problems in their everyday lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when I came across the members of the AWARE Senior Citizens’ Day Care  as a volunteer during a five-day Digital Literacy workshop conducted by  Dream Sparks Foundation, it all came rushing back to me. The women in the day care were all  from a similar section of  society. Even though they live in a world that has been created for their comfort away from the problems that they would  otherwise had to face in their daily lives, some issues are unavoidable. Most of them are above the age of 60 and find it hard to incorporate technology into their daily lives. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belonging to a section of the society which is not just financially a little weak but also educationally, most of the women were not well versed with the basic level of English or even the English numerals. Some of them were from different states , who had come to Delhi to stay with their families and thus were not very fluent in any languages apart from their native tongues. Some were good with Hindi but not with English or the English numerals. Thus recognizing numbers and alphabets on their own keypad phones or even the smart devices we had brought for the workshop, was a task for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a HelpAge volunteer, I had to teach these women how to use the smart devices and help them understand the basic functions of smartphones like making, accepting and declining calls. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop, was a one-of-a-kind experience for me because even though, as I mentioned earlier, I had very closely seen my grandmother struggle with technology, understanding the struggle these women were facing was an eye-opener for me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realised that the same issue is experienced very differently, depending on the social class of a person. While my grandmother belonged to a well-to-do background, most of these women, as I mentioned, were from a financially weaker section and thus their problems were not only limited to the lack of knowledge of technology but also its impact on their daily lives, especially with issues of  lack of means and affordability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the women, asked me if I could buy them the smartphones that I had been teaching them to use. The smart devices had been provided by the foundation to encourage them to learn. It was at this point I realised that even though most of them were eager to learn and keen on using the devices, they knew they couldn’t afford it and thus would either learn only for the sake of it or not learn at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, financial reasons were not the only ones to stop these women from learning; it was also the educational aspect that hampered their learning. While some of them (only two actually) could understand the English numerals and words like “call” and “keypad”, others could only understand the words or the buttons with the help of symbolic representations, like the colours of the buttons or the shapes of the numbers or similar representation of certain buttons. Most of them found it difficult to differentiate between numbers like 6 and 9 or 5 and 2 and thus had to be taught through the understanding of their placement on the keypad.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the women, Bina Ji, told me how she could not understand the English numerals because she had only learnt the Hindi numerals, thus it was very confusing for her. She also mentioned how she saw no point of learning because they will eventually forget everything if they don’t habitually use the devices. “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aap toh roz nahi na aaoge, phir hum isse nahi chalaenge toh bhul na jayenge (You won’t come here every day, then won’t we forget what we learnt since we don’t use smartphones?)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;, she had asked. However, she did not let the learning go to waste as she began to match the numbers from the touchpad of the smartphone to the keypad of her phone and would try to dial the numbers on her own. By the end of the workshop she had complete knowledge of the numbers and their placements and had stopped getting confused by the shape of the numbers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I knew before being a part of this workshop was that people struggle with technology and devices because they’re not familiar with them. But I now understand that there’s so much more as to why they are not familiar with certain things, and there’s usually no one particular answer to this question but multiple and varied answers, which may or may not be interrelated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I also realised is that it’s not always an economic or educational reason behind a person’s inability to learn a certain skill but also their own personal reasons. In this case, some of the women had nobody they wished to contact and thus they were not eager to learn a skill like making calls, as it would make them feel lonelier, while others were handicapped because of medical reasons. And thus it’s easier to judge things on the basis of what one sees but it&#8217;s tougher to go deeper  and understand the roots of why something or somebody is the way it seems to us. This experience has helped me be more aware of the different problems senior citizens face with regards to the digital divide and also made me more equipped to help them overcome them.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is that time of the year again when many of us eagerly await the budget speech of the Finance Minister and hope that the budget speech has all the announcements that will make our lives easier and more comfortable. This year, battered by repeated waves of the pandemic, older persons have more urgently felt needs that need immediate attention. Who else can they approach but their own government to help them out of this seemingly long and dark tunnel? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The needs have remained more or less the same over the last many years, though priorities have shifted depending on extraneous factors. Social security to live life with dignity, geriatric health care and safety &amp; security and inclusion is critical. In the post pandemic phase where older persons are facing shrinking employment opportunities due to lockdowns and decrease in income of the family in many cases, it is of vital significance that social pension be universalized. At least those at the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ as they say, women, disabled, oldest old should be universally covered. Increase in the cost of living makes it difficult for the older persons to cope, so an increase in the central contribution to the ‘Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme’ to  Rs.1000 /month/beneficiary (60-79 years) and Rs.1500 (80+). The purchasing power of the current amount of Rs. 200 is not hard to imagine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poverty can be hidden, as we all know, and those older persons who depend on income from FDs and savings, may not appear poor and stressed, but they do feel the pinch and need a helping hand by way of tax benefits on interest income earned. After all we all know that inflation eats constantly into our savings each year. So, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80TTB interest limit for deduction on income to be increased from Rs.50,000 to Rs.1 lakh. And if possible, raise in income tax exemption limit to Rs. 10 lakh. Higher limits to be particularly considered for older women (60+) and all senior citizens in oldest old segment (80+). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health is of utmost significance in last phase of life and older persons in India have struggled to get affordable, accessible and appropriate health care. The issues of health care financing and infrastructure, needs a hard and serious look. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PMJAY) should make an outreach to universally cover older persons, so that hospitalization needs are covered. National Programme for Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE) should be available in all the districts of the country and its budget should be available exclusively and also monitored likewise. Those paying for their own insurance, a deduction of up to Rs 2 Lakh </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">u/s 80D for medical insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including home care services, for all ailments would be a step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a family is going through crisis who are the members who are expected to make sacrifices, or to put it bluntly who are neglected, mostly older persons and women. If in India we take pride in the fact that the family has till date stood steadfast in being the most important agency of elder care, then when it is stressed due to the pandemic and unable to take on the care burden, it would be desirable to help them continue. Therefore, high time that we consider seriously the proposition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased basic tax exemption of Rs.3.5 lakhs for the independent young-old and Rs.5.5 lakhs for the oldest-old. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has made us all digital savvy out of necessity, but older persons are still far behind. If we want to build back better and leave no one behind, then then should have digital inclusion of older persons to begin with and special allocation for training them and providing them access to the necessary equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we are at building an inclusive future and the future belongs to older persons, as the National Family Health Survey 5 has reiterated, we ought to have at least one ministry exclusively addressing the concerns of the 140 million older persons who are soon expected to be 329 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you and I know, we will be there! Would you like to be ignored? Not me!</span></p>

<p>October 21, 2021 will be remembered as a ‘<em>red letter day</em>’ in the Medical Annals of India. As India achieved the nearly impossible task of researching, testing, producing an indigenous and safe vaccination for its population against COVID-19.</p>
<p>India, not only successfully tested and produced it in its laboratories, but by using its own funds, has already used 100 crores vaccines to vaccinate its population, within a short period of 9 months and 5 days i.e. starting from the scratch from January 16, 2021 to October 22, 2021.</p>
<p>The aim was to vaccinate the entire adult population, estimated to be 940.2 million, with both doses, within a certain gap of time – a month, forty five days or two months, between the two shots. Accordingly, as of today 75% of our adult population have obtained at least one shot and around 31% of them have been fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous achievement by India, but it has to achieve much more and vaccinate the remainder of adults as well as the minor population. It cannot rest on its laurels and has to continue the thrust and fight against the pandemic, so that the suspected and much feared third wave does not occur and is kept at bay for the safety of the entire population of our country.</p>
