				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The floods of July-August 2017 have thrown lives and livelihoods of many elderly out of gear in the four states of Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>HelpAge is responding with urgency and empathy. Leading the Assam relief operations is Nilondra Tanya, State Head North East.</p>
<p>Monsoons this year have led to extensive flooding in different states of India. In <strong>Assam</strong> nearly 33 lakh people were affected as flooding affected as many as 25 of the 32 districts including <em>Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta</em> and <em>Bongaigaon.</em> In <strong>Bihar</strong>, 15.8 million population of 7310 village of 23 district is affected the floods following heavy rainfall and breach of embankments by the <em>Mahananda, Parman, Sursar, Khado, Tilyuga, Kamla, Bagmati, Gandak, Budhi Gandak</em> rivers. The districts of <em>Araria, Purnia, Katihar, Motihari, Darbhanga, Kishanganj, Muzaffapur, Bettiah, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura </em>and <em>Khagaria</em> are among the worst affected according to our on ground staff teams involved in rescue operations. In <strong>Rajasthan</strong>, the five districts of <em>Jalore, Pali, Sirohi, Jodhpur </em>and<em> Barmer</em> having faced incessant rain through the month of July, 2017 forcing lakhs of people to find shelter at higher ground are now staring at the possibility of disease due to vector borne diseases.</p>
<p>These states affected due to severe flood conditions are seeing <strong>massive destruction to houses, livestock, agriculture, land &amp; properties and livelihoods of the local people have been acutely affected.</strong> According to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 1,01,809 people are reeling under the floods just in the two districts alone (<em>Lakhimpur</em> and <em>Karimganj</em>), where 140 villages are under water. The calamity has damaged crops in 385.67 hectares of land. The infrastructure damage includes breach of an agricultural embankment and a PWD road in <em>Lakhimpur</em> district, an embankment in <em>Sonitpur</em> district along with severe erosion in <em>Morigaon</em> district.</p>
<p>HelpAge on-ground teams working in <em>Kamrupmetro</em> and <em>Morigaon,</em> which are some of the worst-hit districts of Assam, tell us, that the state is reeling under, the worst floods in 30 years. Northeast&#8217;s biggest city, Guwahati, saw the <em>Brahmaputra</em> waters swell and cross the danger level mark signaling more havoc. More than 100 people have died and more than 32 lakh affected in 25 districts. More than 41,000 displaced people have taken shelter in 128 relief camps.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-157" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/flood4.jpg" alt="Medical Relief Camp held at L P School Teteliguri village" width="1292" height="969" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -35px;"><em>Day-5 of Medical Relief Camp held at L P School Teteliguri village. 430 patients from Pavekati Gram panchayat, Mayong Development Block, Morigaon District received treatment.</em></p>
<p>Thousands of elderly are in desperate need of relief supplies and basic medicines. We are on the ground, providing food and medical assistance to the affected people. Non-stop daily health camps are being held, under medical consultation of Dr. J N Bordoloi &amp; Dr. N C Boro and four local volunteers from <em>Teteliguri</em> village, who are assisting the HelpAge team.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/flood3.jpg" alt="Health camps being held in flood-hit districts of Assam" width="1280" height="422" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -35px;"><em>Non-stop daily health camps being held in severely affected flood-hit districts of Assam by HelpAge team of doctors.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Current Situation and Plans Ahead</em></strong>: Flood waters have receded significantly, however, many areas continue to be sunk under water and are still cut off by road. Boats continue to be only means of transportation for us for delivering relief and care to the affected.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155" src="https://www.helpageindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/flood2.jpg" alt="HelpAge team deliver relief material in Kamrupmetro district, Assam" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -35px;"><em>HelpAge relief team navigating in boats to deliver relief material in Kamrupmetro district, Assam.</em></p>
<p>Dream Sparks Foundation&#8217;s response has since been initiated in <em>Araria, Madhubani and Darbhanga</em> Districts of Bihar, <em>Chandrapur</em> Development Block in <em>Kamrup </em>Metro and <em>Morigaon </em>districts of Assam and in four blocks of <em>Barmer</em> District in Rajasthan. Upon completion of the <strong>Medical Relief Efforts</strong> over a planned period of 15 days, <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> plans to reach out <strong>Food and Non-food Relief</strong> to at least 3000 households in the three states. We are preparing to provide more hygiene and sanitation kits, cooking material and food baskets to the most-affected locals. To support our on-ground action, please consider contributing here: <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/disaster-strikes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.helpageindia.org/disaster-strikes.html</a></p>
<p>Every contribution adds to making a considerable difference in the life of an affected disaster survivor. It&#8217;s time to join hands for an even more determined impact.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/impact-of-your-donations-assamfloods2017/">Impact of Your Donations: #AssamFloods2017</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><i>A Personification of Our Depleting Value System</i></h4>
<p><strong>Mallamma, 102 years, supported by son Siddaiah, 75 years at Kunthur Village, Mysore, Karnataka (in the picture). This is a rare and heart-rending example where an elderly son is taking care of his aged parent within his most modest means and ability. However, this is not a norm in the rest of India. Where did the urbanised India go wrong in caring for its Elders?</strong></p>
<p>According to a study conducted by <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> in 2014, over 50% elderly surveyed, have reported abuse. Many suffer violence, neglect and isolation on a daily basis at the hands of their own children. According to census 2011, almost 15 million elderly Indians live all alone and close to three-fourths of them are women. While some who live alone have taken a conscious decision to do so, many others do this because of lack of option. They have been isolated, neglected, hounded out and housed in <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/programs/old-age-homes.html">old age homes</a>, because they are the victims of fast eroding social values in their own children and society at large. The younger generation who consider the senior citizens limiting their &#8216;independence&#8217; subject them to neglect &#8211; almost every day, we hear stories of elderly people from well-to-do families, living on the streets after being ill-treated by their children.</p>
<p>Traditional Indian society cared and respected the old age and the wisdom, abilities and confidence, that came with it. The older family members also reciprocated, guiding them, supporting and nurturing them with love and affection. But with urbanization, Indian society underwent a rapid transformation too just like the other countries globally. But the social fabric bonding of India saw larger deviation than any other country, because of what it has been as a set-up since ages. Children who migrated, left their old parents in the village, causing problems of loneliness and lack of care givers for old parents. Traditional values and family system started weakening and degenerating for the first time. Intergenerational ties that were once the hallmark of the traditional family system broke down. The care of elderly, therefore, has emerged as an important issue in India. Population ageing in numerous ways is a demographic accomplishment, fuelled by major advancements associated with improved health facilities. However, this growth in numbers clearly has had a far reaching implication in the social threadwork for which neither the government at the macro level nor the family of the elderly at the micro level have shown much care.</p>
<p>Another significant factor is, earlier, when a value based joint family system was dominant, providing <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/programs/old-age-homes.html">care for the aged</a> was not a problem. However, the vulnerability of elderly is rapidly increasing with a growing trend towards nuclear family set-up.</p>
<p>Also, due to lack of wisdom and the challenges of modern life, the coping capacities of the younger and elder family members are now being challenged, resulting in neglect and abuse of the elderly in many ways. Parents have to take care of themselves in these circumstances. If they are able bodied, it works, if not, then they become vulnerable.</p>
<p>Another development impacting negatively on the status of older people is the increasing occurrence of dual career nuclear families. This development has implications for elderly care. On one hand, working couples find the presence of old parents emotionally bonding and of great help in the caring for their own children. On the other hand, high costs of housing and health care are making it harder for children to have parents live with them in constrained spaces. Work life pressure in nuclear families has contributed immensely to isolation of seniors at households. This is true both in rural and urban areas. <a href="http://helpage-india.blogspot.in/2016/03/top-corporates-commit-to-supporting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Though recently many corporates like IBM, Deloitte and American Express have started initiatives to brilliantly support their employees&#8217; ageing parents</a> the situation of care giving for elders is still very dismal.</p>
<p>Sociologically, ageing marks a form of transition from one set of social roles to another, and such roles are difficult. The shift into the new role of the &#8216;old&#8217; is one of the most complex and complicated among all role transformation in the course of ageing. In a historically agriculture based traditional society, where children followed their parent&#8217;s occupation, it was natural that the expertise and knowledge of each generation were passed on to the next. However, this is no longer true in modern society, in which improved education, rapid change in technology and new forms of organization have often rendered obsolete the knowledge, experience and wisdom of older persons. Presence of smartphones and social media-isolation of elders has only added to the problem. Elderly people find that once they retire, their children do not seek advice from them anymore, and society is side-lining them on many fronts. This realization often results in feeling of loss of status, worthlessness and loneliness. Neither having authority in the family, nor being needed, they feel frustrated and depressed. If the older person is economically dependent on the children, the problem is likely to become even worse. One HelpAge survey in 2014 found out that 45% elderly who reported abuse, faced it only because they were economically dependent on the abuser.</p>
<p>The most pressing concern lies with the process of &#8216;isolation&#8217; that the elderly are subjected to. The most crucial step lies in addressing this. This can be done by treating the elderly with the love and respect, which they deserve. For this, it is important to instil values of love, compassion and respect for every human being from childhood. Through Values-Based Education programs, values should be instilled not only in children but also parents and teachers. Further,<a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"> NGOs</a> and social sector must work both with children and elderly alike, by counselling each segment how to coexist in home spaces even with varying areas of interest. Once the Elderly at our homes are truly revered and the child within them is cared for, the sense of aloofness and detachment felt by senior citizens can be done away with and old age be made a holistically rewarding experience. Social Media could be used as a tool by young children to make Elderly inclusive in their moments of fun and family times, so that, by simple gestures bonding can spread only further more.</p>

<p>Limca Book of Records recognizes the ‘oldest’ Badminton team of the country. The Unique Badminton Club of the Senior Citizens Society in Freedom Fighters Enclave, Neb Sarai, Delhi, headed by Captain &amp; coach 76 year old, K. D. Bhatia. What makes them unique is not only their age but their spirit. The average age of the members of this team is 72 years, many have gone through open heart surgeries. Every morning at 6:30 am a team of 12 to 15 retired senior citizens from the Society troop down to their neighborhood park in Freedom Fighters Enclave, Neb Sarai. A full two hour badminton session keeps them fit and active. Their never-say-die-spirit makes them a remarkable example of Active Ageing. A special mention must be made of Mr. Suresh Palta, 73, President of the Society and Mr. S. C. Karanwal, 74, Treasurer of <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/programs/active-ageing-centres.html">Senior Citizens Society</a>, Freedom Fighters Enclave, Delhi who run this unique Society for Seniors.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/limca-book-of-records-recognizes-a-unique-badminton-team-of-seniors/">Limca Book of Records recognizes a unique Badminton team of Seniors!</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>APJ Abdul Kalam was truly a People’s President, inspiring millions with his indomitable spirit and a true example of Active Ageing. Till the last day of his life, he was travelling, speaking to the youth and living the life he preached. A man with deep rooted values, he always emphasized on the importance of the joint family. On Oct. 1st 2003, speaking at a <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">HelpAge</a> function at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, he said, “On the International Day of Older Persons, it is only appropriate that we continue to remember and show our gratitude to our elders, whose debt we can never repay.” He died after a massive cardiac arrest on July 27th, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong. He was 83. Known as the Missile Man of India, Dr. Kalam played a pivotal role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan and Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honor, for his achievements.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/adieu-kalam-sir-you-made-our-country-rise/">Adieu Kalam Sir, You Made Our Country Rise!</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
