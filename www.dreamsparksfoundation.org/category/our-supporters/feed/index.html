				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Happiness &#8211; Is it bequeathed to us by our environment, genetics, God or the people around us? Or is happiness a ‘skill’ we acquire by investing more time in ourselves and our loved ones?</em></p>
<p>Happiness is a positive emotional state of joy and contentment. Our genetic predispositions, our life story, and our environment are all factors that influence our happiness levels. But another very important factor is us. We too, can choose to positively influence our lives and work towards living a more fulfilled life.</p>
<p>Vaillant et al. in their article on Retirement Satisfaction found out something interesting. The risk factors (such as low income, depression and poor health) that lead to poor adjustment in young adulthood and midlife do not correlate to dissatisfaction in retirement. They point out that there are many ways that we can compensate for all such risk factors as we age. This confirms that by making healthy decisions, we can choose happiness. Let’s choose happiness by actively seeking it. Given below are the some ways we can do that.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hobbies and interests &#8211;</strong> Hobbies are excellent addition to our daily otherwise, possibly mundane routine, especially post retirement. They are enjoyable activities that keep us active and engaged. Unfortunately, many of us don’t even have a hobby &#8211; but we do all have interest areas. If we have hobby or no idea of what it could be, we can start by exploring things related to our interests such as art, sports, travel, read, take part in theater if that interests you, try socializing or go out for nature walks. Retirement will finally give us the time to explore and dive into our interest areas and find our hobbies. Pursuing such interests and living for one-self positively affects our happiness levels.</li>
<li><strong>Travel Plans and vacations &#8211;</strong> With more time, fewer responsibilities and high aspirations, you can enjoy a vacation anywhere you like. Retirement gives you ample time to explore the world like never before. Travel could be done to far off places or it could be a quiet place nearby. It could be a high budget cruise or a low budget road trip. Many older people take our time from their retirement to visit their home town or go on a spiritual trip. Many others travel across the world to new cities and countries. Planning a vacation is exciting and many destinations can help us create ‘awe moments’ when we are overwhelmed by our experience. Clearly, vacations are a good way to invest in our happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy relationships &#8211;</strong> Relationships are our source of support and they help us feel a sense of love and belonging. Maintaining healthy relations with close family and friends helps ensure that we have a solid emotional support system around us that will help us survive almost anything. Research has also shown time and again that satisfaction in marriage highly correlates to satisfaction in life.</li>
<li><strong>Stay fit &#8211;</strong> “To keep the body in good health is a duty&#8230; otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.” ~ BuddhaTo be able to keep our mind clear and ready to enjoy all that the world has to offer, we must pay attention to our physical health. Exercise helps us keep fit. It can be a daily walk, a sport or the gym, some form of exercise is important for fitness. Exercise also releases mood enhancing endorphins, making us feel happy.</li>
<li><strong>Good sleep &#8211;</strong> This is another important factor that decides our happiness levels. Make sure to get enough rest every night and don’t take it lightly if you’re not able to. Find a sleep specialist if needed, to ensure restful sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Kindness and Gratitude &#8211;</strong> “Those who bring sunshine to the lives of other cannot keep it from themselves.” ~ James Matthew BarrieShowing kindness to others is one way we can feel contentment. Take any opportunity you get to grab happiness for yourself by doing something nice for another. Expressing gratitude is another such life hack. Feeling thankful for the many things in the life we lead, helps bring into focus all such things rather than cursing small voids that exist and comparing with the others only yields discontentment.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of Purpose &#8211;</strong> No matter what our age, we need to feel purposeful in our lives. We can feel a sense of purpose when we are trying to achieve something. You might also want to bring about some changes in your immediate community, or volunteer at a blind school or offer your services or sewa at an institution of your choice. Many elderly also find sense of purpose in taking care of family such as grandchildren. Some wish to go on spiritual pilgrimages. Whatever gives you a sense of purpose, try holding on to it as it helps feel a greater sense of contentment and happiness.</li>

Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), a Govt. of India &#8211; Navratna Enterprise, has extended CSR support for Rs.3.50 crore to <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> for F.Y. 2017-18, for the construction and operation of a shelter home with a wellness facility for elders at Shey-village, Leh-Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir. The project is being undertaken at Shey village, Leh-Ladakh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir through the CSR arm of the corporation i.e. REC Foundation. With this support, HelpAge is setting up an integrated model facility for elder care.</p>
<p>The aim is to build a cluster of 10 block homes initially and then increase as per demand and availability of resources. Each unit would house 4-5 elders and provide facilities of recreation, boarding, lodging and a prayer room. Activities like cattle rearing, kitchen gardening are also planned along with the visits of the local ‘<em>Aamchi</em>’ (the Tibetan Medicine man) and a volunteer physician to look after their medical needs. This project has been blessed by His Holiness Dalai Lama.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Whatever you do, don’t tell Maa about her Dementia Diagnosis.”</em></p>
<p>Doctors often hear this line because the families of the person diagnosed with Dementia are worried that the truth will destroy their loved one and will cause depression and sorrow.</p>
<p>Some of the doctors agree with this point, but many doctors believe that it is the patients right to be informed about their condition. Even patients with dementia should hear the reality of their situation and be informed about the disease. Acceptance of something is the first step towards addressing it.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping the diagnosis a mystery makes it difficult to involve the person with dementia in the course of action for progress.</strong> If you keep it a secret many things would become very difficult to follow, for example engaging them in brain stimulating activities, managing medications etc.</p>
<p>Open communication helps in increasing the ability to handle difficult behavior that a loved one may portray.</p>
<div class="curve_desn">
<p><strong>A few considerations that will be helpful when talking to your loved one about their diagnosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are in a quiet place with good lighting and no distractions.</li>
<li>Set a positive mood for communicating. Make sure you both are relaxed.</li>
<li>Speak clearly and slowly and give one message at a time.</li>
<li>Allow the person to understand the condition and ask questions regarding it. Let your loved one take enough time to absorb information.</li>
<li>Ensure your loved one that someone is always available for their support.</li>
<li>Tell them that there is nothing to hide about it. Open candid communication is the key.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Following are few steps that you can follow, if you are facing any difficulty in sharing Dementia diagnosis with your loved one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as you can about Dementia so you can address your loved one with certainty and answer questions related to the disease without creating an atmosphere of embarrassment for them. It is a medical condition and no patient should be made to feel awkward about it.</li>
<li>You can begin by saying that you are worried about their memory and inquire as to whether they have similar concerns. They may have noticed they are forgetting things, and not able to write or read very well lately or they may have found themselves feeling worried or moody.</li>
<li>They may deny that anything is wrong with them. Don’t argue with them if anything like this happens. You could give particular cases of things that have happened recently to cause concern. Be particular and ensure you have several key occurrences. Yet, be set up for the way that they may not recall them. Let your love and understanding lead the conversation.</li>
<li>If the doctor has clarified the situation, adopt a positive strategy. For example, tell your Mom that she is not the only one, that many individuals have this condition and that there is a great deal of life left!</li>
<li>Answer your loved one&#8217;s inquiries completely, yet push the positive—for instance, that memory pills may help, and that research continues to locate a superior treatment or cure. Share Information about the condition and how it can be managed. Share information regarding the medications and healthy meal plans. Let your care for them, win over their anxiety.</li>
<li>Emphasize that you will always be present in every part of their journey. Your confidence and positive tone will comfort them. At the end of the conversation, agree and decide on a care plan of what will happen next and reassure them at every stage of the conversation. Let them know you are there to help and that you want to make sure they are okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, have empathy for the loved one in your care, and communicate with a cheery, positive spirit. <strong>Engage your loved one in meaningful and brain stimulating activities which will help in building their confidence and self-esteem.</strong> Also, provide them with great care and loving support. And if the journey becomes overpowering to you then seek professional help, join support groups, attend workshops on Dementia, or hire trained caregivers.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of Dementia can leave a person detached from others. Just make sure that the person is socially connected with people they want to spend time with. This helps in keeping them engaged.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Don’t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.” </em>&#8211; Barack Obama</p>
<p>On Thursday, 9th June, I went to Gheja Village in the District of Noida as a part of a Dream Sparks Foundation initiative to provide free mobile healthcare to the disadvantaged and poor elderly. It was early in the morning when we got into an MHU which is a Mobile Health Unit and travelled towards the village. An MHU is a small bus which consists of a trained medical professional, a pharmacist, an SPO (State Protection Officer) and a trained driver who also registers patients. It has all the necessary medical equipment and medicines that are handed out by the pharmacist after the doctor prescribes them on examining the elderly patient. The MMU has seats for the patients to sit on while the doctor attends to them.</p>
<p>The Gheja Village is located right behind a series of tall residential buildings almost as if to show the contrast between the rich and the less fortunate in our country. The village was quiet initially as it was early in the day but from around 11am people started approaching the MHU. I was assisting the driver in registering patients and making new identification cards for unregistered people. There were around 1400 registered patients from the village but only 50 showed up on that particular day. It was good to know that all of those 50 patients who needed medicines and medical help had access to <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development/mobile-healthcare">mobile healthcare</a> right at their doorstep, via Dream Sparks Foundation’s programme services.</p>
<p>The villagers were polite and patient and nothing like the typical stereotype placed on them. I was shocked when I came across a patient who was a 19 year old girl who had been married for 5 years. Instances like this make us realise how absorbed we are in our “first world problems” that we become desensitized to the real issues around us. It is saddening that I have the opportunity to get an education and decide what to do with my future whereas another girl exactly my age has to get married and have her independence taken from her. Because the only thing differentiating us is our background, and that is not enough of a reason to deny someone the right to choose their future. I was happy that though <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> treats the elderly patients, when a young patient really in need came to the mobile medicine van, she wasn’t shunned but empathetically addressed and the doctor helped her as well.</p>
<p>What I learnt from this visit was certainly something that I could not have learnt elsewhere. It was an extremely humbling experience and taught me a lot about the issues of communities that people generally avoid addressing. I believe that organisations like Dream Sparks Foundation are making a remarkable change in how we go about <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/welfare-development">caring for the elderly</a> of our country. I’m very grateful for this opportunity and the learning I have gained from it and I hope I come across another one like this in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marking ‘International Day of Older Persons’ this year, <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org">Dream Sparks Foundation</a> pushed forth the importance of inter-generational bonding through its HUG – Help Unite Generations campaign. Emphasizing the need for love, care, respect and friendship between both the young and old, it marked the day across India. In the national capital, the Hon’ble Vice President of India Shri Hamid Ansari, highlighted the increasing gap in inter-generational ties. &#8220;The Indian society is undergoing rapid urbanization under the impact of industrialization and globalization. Traditional values and institutions are changing resulting in weakening of inter-generational ties. Transition from rural agrarian setup to urban industrial way of life, migration from villages to cities and increasingly abroad, forces the young generation to leave their elderly alone back home&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Similarly across India, inter-generational walkathons, signature campaigns, street plays, inter-generational meets and various other event were organized, to bring home the fact that it is vital for both generations to bond and be support systems for each other.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/helpage-highlights-the-importance-of-the-hug-help-unite-generations-campaign/">HelpAge highlights the importance of the HUG (Help Unite Generations) campaign on International Day of Older Persons</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.helpageindia.org"></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
