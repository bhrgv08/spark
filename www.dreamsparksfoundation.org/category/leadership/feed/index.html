				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HelpAge suffered a deep loss on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020, as of one of its pillars, Mrs. Indrani Rajadurai passed away, leaving the HelpAge family bereft. She leaves behind a legacy of serving the disadvantaged elder community, with footsteps hard to follow.</p>
<p>Indrani started her journey in HelpAge, at the young age of 26 on 1<sup>st</sup> January 1977. She dedicated nearly 4 decades of her life to the elder cause. Even though she officially retired from HelpAge at the age of 60, her connection with the organization &amp; the elder cause remained, as she took on the role of Special Advisor. Indrani has been with HelpAge virtually since its birth, she started out as a Sponsored Events Officer, raw on her skills but with great zeal to make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate elderly. She was trained by the founder himself Mr. Samson Daniel and Mr. Philip Jackson and Mr. John .F. Pearson of HelpAge International. She went on to become the first woman officer at HelpAge.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Indrani Rajadurai, leads the first ever Sponsored Walk with young school students in Chennai.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Her passion towards her work, shone through her tenure, as she went from strength-to-strength and took on further responsibilities, never hesitating even once. Her commitment to the cause of the elderly and her connection with them was indescribable. Her own growth within the organization was rapid, as she went on to become Deputy Director (South) then Joint Director (South), Regional Director (South) and finally retired as National Director (South &amp; West).</p>
<p>“<em>The organization gave me a wonderful opportunity to serve the elders through the younger generation by organizing Sponsored walks in schools which were a unique Education cum Fundraising event in those days</em>”. – said Indrani.</p>
<p>New initiatives for the elderly were tested and launched successfully during her tenures such as Pay Roll Giving, Pre-Retirement Training, the first ever Elder Helpline in Chennai, and many more. When the Tsunami struck in the Coastal area in 2004, she was one of the first few people who rushed to the disaster site to help the victims. Few know, that in the disaster, she too had suffered the loss of her near and dear ones, but Indrani kept on working with a fever pitch, putting in all her energy in saving those that were alive and in need of help. It left a deep impact on her.</p>
<p>Indrani was a catalyst in bringing together schools and corporates especially for the southern regions to come forward and show their sensitivity to the cause. Her consistent efforts in sensitizing children on the importance of agecare values and being sensitive to the elderly have left an indelible mark in the hearts of many.</p>
<p>Thanks to her efforts the Tamil Nadu State Government recognized HelpAge as a leading national level NGO and appointed her as a member of their Planning Commission, member in their Grant approval committee and as an advisor for Government Programs. Positions she continued to capitalize on, to make sure that the elderly and the less fortunate were not forgotten. For her efforts she had been conferred with the Best Social worker Award twice. She also received the Best Woman Achiever Award by corporates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all want our parents to be taken care of, especially in old age. Assisting our loved ones in India as they grow old is a right of passage for many families, as we all can acknowledge how important it is to do our part in promoting the well-being and health of the elderly. If you have decided to move your parents into your own home, there are certain renovations that can be done to make the space more comfortable and secure.</p>
<p>Even if you plan on the living situation being temporary, a mere transitional period for your loved one between independent living and moving to an assisted living facility, you still need to be aware of certain interior changes that should be made. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2634/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key elements to a safe home</a> equipped for aging and healthcare needs include safety, mobility, security, comfort, and independence. By adding <a href="https://www.architypes.net/home-safety-for-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several elderly-friendly home renovations</a>, you can help your parents to age happily in the comfort of your family’s home.</p>
<p><strong>Start with the Basics</strong></p>
<p>Growing old is not easy, especially in India, where health and livelihood security is not always guaranteed. But you can make the process of aging easier for your parents by considering basic updates that can be made to your home before they move in. Ask your parents how they spend a typical day, and assess how your current interior layout will accommodate their daily activities.</p>
<p>Do a quick assessment of all of the structural elements of your home: are your doorways wide enough for wheelchair access, if necessary? Are the stairs to get into the home too steep? Keep in mind that many falls happen because of carpeting and rugs. Also, swapping out rounded door handles can ease the strain on arthritic hands.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the Bathroom</strong></p>
<p>In addition to these basic considerations, one room that should be given careful thought is the bathroom. Start by measuring the toilet. Many typical toilets are rather low and can prove difficult to stand up after using. Installing a helpful grab bar or another toilet entirely that has more height is a wise idea. This way, your parents can painlessly use the bathroom on their own without any difficulty. Another bathroom update that could be made is adding bars or railings to the shower/bathtub. Grab bars can make getting in and out of the shower/bathtub much safer, as they provide much needed stability. Also, a shower/bathtub chair is a simple, portable option to make your loved ones’ hygienic needs be cared for in an easier manner.</p>
<p>By making these simple renovations to your home, you can guarantee that your elderly parents can move in and live in your home safely and happily.</p>
