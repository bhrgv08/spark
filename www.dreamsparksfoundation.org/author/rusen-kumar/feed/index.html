<p>Chief Guest of the camp Rusen Kumar said that elderly people need additional care in winter seasons. “Exercise and other social engagement activities can have a positive impact on the mind and body of the elderly.”,he said. Kumar said that the community based programs have significant role to play in care of the elderly population, particularly in rural areas. Awareness programmes and social services are the key to the community based programmes for the welfare of elderly.</p>
<p>“We must involve our youth in welfare programmes across all level. Bridging the gap between relief and development is a great way to serve the community”, he added.</p>
