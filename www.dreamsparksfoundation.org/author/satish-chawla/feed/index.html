				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Happiness &#8211; Is it bequeathed to us by our environment, genetics, God or the people around us? Or is happiness a ‘skill’ we acquire by investing more time in ourselves and our loved ones?</em></p>
<p>Happiness is a positive emotional state of joy and contentment. Our genetic predispositions, our life story, and our environment are all factors that influence our happiness levels. But another very important factor is us. We too, can choose to positively influence our lives and work towards living a more fulfilled life.</p>
<p>Vaillant et al. in their article on Retirement Satisfaction found out something interesting. The risk factors (such as low income, depression and poor health) that lead to poor adjustment in young adulthood and midlife do not correlate to dissatisfaction in retirement. They point out that there are many ways that we can compensate for all such risk factors as we age. This confirms that by making healthy decisions, we can choose happiness. Let’s choose happiness by actively seeking it. Given below are the some ways we can do that.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hobbies and interests &#8211;</strong> Hobbies are excellent addition to our daily otherwise, possibly mundane routine, especially post retirement. They are enjoyable activities that keep us active and engaged. Unfortunately, many of us don’t even have a hobby &#8211; but we do all have interest areas. If we have hobby or no idea of what it could be, we can start by exploring things related to our interests such as art, sports, travel, read, take part in theater if that interests you, try socializing or go out for nature walks. Retirement will finally give us the time to explore and dive into our interest areas and find our hobbies. Pursuing such interests and living for one-self positively affects our happiness levels.</li>
<li><strong>Travel Plans and vacations &#8211;</strong> With more time, fewer responsibilities and high aspirations, you can enjoy a vacation anywhere you like. Retirement gives you ample time to explore the world like never before. Travel could be done to far off places or it could be a quiet place nearby. It could be a high budget cruise or a low budget road trip. Many older people take our time from their retirement to visit their home town or go on a spiritual trip. Many others travel across the world to new cities and countries. Planning a vacation is exciting and many destinations can help us create ‘awe moments’ when we are overwhelmed by our experience. Clearly, vacations are a good way to invest in our happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy relationships &#8211;</strong> Relationships are our source of support and they help us feel a sense of love and belonging. Maintaining healthy relations with close family and friends helps ensure that we have a solid emotional support system around us that will help us survive almost anything. Research has also shown time and again that satisfaction in marriage highly correlates to satisfaction in life.</li>
<li><strong>Stay fit &#8211;</strong> “To keep the body in good health is a duty&#8230; otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.” ~ BuddhaTo be able to keep our mind clear and ready to enjoy all that the world has to offer, we must pay attention to our physical health. Exercise helps us keep fit. It can be a daily walk, a sport or the gym, some form of exercise is important for fitness. Exercise also releases mood enhancing endorphins, making us feel happy.</li>
<li><strong>Good sleep &#8211;</strong> This is another important factor that decides our happiness levels. Make sure to get enough rest every night and don’t take it lightly if you’re not able to. Find a sleep specialist if needed, to ensure restful sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Kindness and Gratitude &#8211;</strong> “Those who bring sunshine to the lives of other cannot keep it from themselves.” ~ James Matthew BarrieShowing kindness to others is one way we can feel contentment. Take any opportunity you get to grab happiness for yourself by doing something nice for another. Expressing gratitude is another such life hack. Feeling thankful for the many things in the life we lead, helps bring into focus all such things rather than cursing small voids that exist and comparing with the others only yields discontentment.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of Purpose &#8211;</strong> No matter what our age, we need to feel purposeful in our lives. We can feel a sense of purpose when we are trying to achieve something. You might also want to bring about some changes in your immediate community, or volunteer at a blind school or offer your services or sewa at an institution of your choice. Many elderly also find sense of purpose in taking care of family such as grandchildren. Some wish to go on spiritual pilgrimages. Whatever gives you a sense of purpose, try holding on to it as it helps feel a greater sense of contentment and happiness.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizebeth Kubler Ross devoted her life to the care of the dying. She lived an hour away from the institution where she spent her day and commuted to her home in her private car. Realizing the loss of time she moved closer to her place of work and soon realized that she was suffering from emotional exhaustion. Moving back to her original home seemed to help. During her commute while crossing a busy street she had a realization. She noticed that on crossing that street, her mental and emotional state changed from a care giver to a householder. Clearly, the time and distance from work allowed her to reconnect with herself and her life outside of work.</p>
<p>The emotional exhaustion faced by Ms. Ross is also known as <strong>Compassion Fatigue</strong>. Compassion fatigue is the frustration you may feel taking care of a loved one with Dementia. Wikipedia says, ‘<strong>Compassion fatigue</strong>, also known as <strong>secondary traumatic stress</strong> (<strong>STS</strong>), is a condition characterized by a gradual lessening of compassion over time. It is common among individuals that work directly with trauma victims such as, therapists (paid and unpaid), nurses, teachers, psychologists, police officers, paramedics, animal welfare workers, health unit coordinators and anyone who helps out others, especially family members, relatives, and other informal caregivers of patients suffering from a chronic illness. It was first diagnosed in nurses in the 1950s.’</p>
<p><strong>Sadly, in this process the caregiver starts overlooking their own health and their personal needs. They feel more and more impatient and find themselves feeling angry, guilty and often helpless. They may feel that their empathy and compassion is wearing off with their tolerance going down. </strong></p>
<p>To work as a care giver, one has to recognize the needs of person being cared for and empathize with that person. This is essential for effective care giving. Love and empathy are positive emotions but in can be difficult to bring those emotions into play if one is emotionally drained.</p>
<p>While Ms. Ross found a way of separating herself from the situation, the same is not available to most caregivers in a typical household with a person with a severe chronic ailment, dementia, or more. <strong>Recognizing compassion fatigue is the first step in trying to find relief.</strong></p>
<p>As a caregiver, one needs to be able to take out time for oneself. To be able to care for another, it is essential to take care of one’s own self, both emotionally and physically. Taking out time to eat right, exercise, socialize and do leisure activities is very important.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why is there increasing dependence on sole caregivers?</em></strong></p>
<p>Two cogent changes are happening in our society simultaneously. One change is the increase in the length of our life and thus period of life during which we are dependent. The second is the decay in the traditional joint family system that puts the onus of care on isolated members of the family (usually the daughter or daughter-in-law).  Caregivers, in most cases, are the immediate family members of the elderly who are often unprepared to shoulder this burden of an ailing patient at home.</p>
<p>Despite of these changes, in most situations, care is given without any outside support or respite care. The caregiver is often also a mother, a father, a wife, a husband. The caregiver often also has a job and financial responsibilities. In some families, one has to give up their job to assume the role of a caregiver, thereby increasing the financial burdens. Eventually, the caregiver is burdened with increased responsibilities that they were often unprepared for</p>
<p><strong><em>Negative Impact on Caregivers, Compassion Fatigue and Burnout</em></strong></p>
<p>Caregivers who reported experiencing compassion fatigue, expressed such feelings as, “<em>I frequently dissociated and felt that I walked around in an altered state. I didn&#8217;t realize that I had been in a grey space all year</em>.” and “<em>It got to the point where I would feel physically sick before the appointment and would start feeling nauseous.”</em> Others described that they picked up their dependent’s symptoms and explained that they had “tightness in the exact same spot” as the dependent and often continued to carry the sensation sometimes for days.</p>
<p>Abundant data is present in literature showing that caregivers suffer from panoply of adverse effects that include depression, isolation, obesity etc. that harm the mental and physical health of the caregiver. Evidences of chronic stress in the form of elevated cortisol levels and lowered immunity have also been demonstrated. In a recent report in the Gerontologist ’17 Drs. Dassel, Carr, and Vitaliano have shown that caretakers suffer from a higher incidence of dementia.</p>
<p>The chronic stress associated with care-giving is associated with an adverse impact on various domains of cognition including immediate, delayed and working memory. Other aspects of mental health i.e. psychomotor responsiveness and emotional responses have all been shown to be adversely effected. Older individuals have compromised physiological ability to deal with chronic stress effectively. The lack of sleep, social isolation, the lack of positive feedback, and no entertainment or relief, are all contributing factors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the helpers&#8217; symptoms frequently go unnoticed. The psychological symptoms range from issues such as dissociation, anger, anxiety, sleep disturbances, nightmares, to feeling powerless. They may also experience physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, general constriction, bodily temperature changes, dizziness, fainting spells, and impaired hearing. All are important warning signals for the caregiver that need to be addressed or otherwise might lead to health issues and <strong>burnout</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Respite Care as a Solution</strong></p>
<p>While the need for support in the field of elder care is obvious and the finding that the people involved with elder care are also at risk makes the need of support even more urgent.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the western countries the care of the elderly is often relegated to ‘nursing home’ care where care is given by workers who may not be emotionally invested in the individual. That is why many believe that care is best given in a home environment by the family.</p>
<p><em>So, how do we protect our family from the adverse emotional, social and health effects of caregiving? </em></p>
<p><strong>Respite care</strong> is the answer, especially in instances where the primary care giver is nearing physical and emotional exhaustion. The family is best supported by relieving the stress of care by periods of relief which we call ‘respite care’. Allowing a hired specialist to take care of the elderly from time to time can help provide a sense of relief to the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>For example, many individuals with dementia require full time help for their basic day to day tasks such as bathing, dressing, bathroom visits etc. which can be taken care of by a nurse or attendant. However, a caregiver goes beyond these basic tasks and looks out for the overall well-being of the person.</p>
<p>Many respite care services, like <em>Samvedna Senior Care</em>, provide uniquely qualified care specialists who are able to provide meaningful and purposeful engagement. The additional benefit of hiring specialists is that they have been trained on recognized techniques of mental stimulation that are known to slow the progress of Dementia as much as possible.</p>
<p>Such services allow the elderly to live at home in a caring environment. Creating this essential support system of care ensures that we are doing the best we can not only for the elderly, but also for the caregivers who are dedicating themselves to this noble task. Enabling the elderly to live their life in their own home is the best gift that can be given to them in the last years of their life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Whatever you do, don’t tell Maa about her Dementia Diagnosis.”</em></p>
<p>Doctors often hear this line because the families of the person diagnosed with Dementia are worried that the truth will destroy their loved one and will cause depression and sorrow.</p>
<p>Some of the doctors agree with this point, but many doctors believe that it is the patients right to be informed about their condition. Even patients with dementia should hear the reality of their situation and be informed about the disease. Acceptance of something is the first step towards addressing it.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping the diagnosis a mystery makes it difficult to involve the person with dementia in the course of action for progress.</strong> If you keep it a secret many things would become very difficult to follow, for example engaging them in brain stimulating activities, managing medications etc.</p>
<p>Open communication helps in increasing the ability to handle difficult behavior that a loved one may portray.</p>
<div class="curve_desn">
<p><strong>A few considerations that will be helpful when talking to your loved one about their diagnosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are in a quiet place with good lighting and no distractions.</li>
<li>Set a positive mood for communicating. Make sure you both are relaxed.</li>
<li>Speak clearly and slowly and give one message at a time.</li>
<li>Allow the person to understand the condition and ask questions regarding it. Let your loved one take enough time to absorb information.</li>
<li>Ensure your loved one that someone is always available for their support.</li>
<li>Tell them that there is nothing to hide about it. Open candid communication is the key.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Following are few steps that you can follow, if you are facing any difficulty in sharing Dementia diagnosis with your loved one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as you can about Dementia so you can address your loved one with certainty and answer questions related to the disease without creating an atmosphere of embarrassment for them. It is a medical condition and no patient should be made to feel awkward about it.</li>
<li>You can begin by saying that you are worried about their memory and inquire as to whether they have similar concerns. They may have noticed they are forgetting things, and not able to write or read very well lately or they may have found themselves feeling worried or moody.</li>
<li>They may deny that anything is wrong with them. Don’t argue with them if anything like this happens. You could give particular cases of things that have happened recently to cause concern. Be particular and ensure you have several key occurrences. Yet, be set up for the way that they may not recall them. Let your love and understanding lead the conversation.</li>
<li>If the doctor has clarified the situation, adopt a positive strategy. For example, tell your Mom that she is not the only one, that many individuals have this condition and that there is a great deal of life left!</li>
<li>Answer your loved one&#8217;s inquiries completely, yet push the positive—for instance, that memory pills may help, and that research continues to locate a superior treatment or cure. Share Information about the condition and how it can be managed. Share information regarding the medications and healthy meal plans. Let your care for them, win over their anxiety.</li>
<li>Emphasize that you will always be present in every part of their journey. Your confidence and positive tone will comfort them. At the end of the conversation, agree and decide on a care plan of what will happen next and reassure them at every stage of the conversation. Let them know you are there to help and that you want to make sure they are okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, have empathy for the loved one in your care, and communicate with a cheery, positive spirit. <strong>Engage your loved one in meaningful and brain stimulating activities which will help in building their confidence and self-esteem.</strong> Also, provide them with great care and loving support. And if the journey becomes overpowering to you then seek professional help, join support groups, attend workshops on Dementia, or hire trained caregivers.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of Dementia can leave a person detached from others. Just make sure that the person is socially connected with people they want to spend time with. This helps in keeping them engaged.</p>
