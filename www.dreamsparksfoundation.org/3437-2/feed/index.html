		<description><![CDATA[hello 
very useful and great article ne of Dream Sparks Foundation’s Mobile Healthcare Unit (MHU) site, is almost deserted, empty harbours and landing centers, empty streets, which was once a bustling town with constant movement an activity going on. Due to social distancing, a few fisher women are allowed to buy fishes from the fishermen and sell it in the market. People are afraid to come out and buy fishes, thereby reducing the income of these fishermen and women who are trying hard to survive and make ends meet.
pleaase keep it good]]></description>
